# CI is my DJ

> Cuz why not lmao

## Why?

Because I am too lazy to find new songs.

## How?

I love Spotify's curated playlists. So I created a CI which scans for new songs in those and adds them to a monthly
updating digest! 

## TODO

- [x] Implement basic functions
- [x] Make the fucking CI (urgent)
- [ ] Automatic monthly playlist creation
