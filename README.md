# CI is my DJ

> Cuz why not lmao

## Why?

Because I am too lazy to find new songs.

## How?

I love Spotify's curated playlists. So I created a CI which scans for new songs in those and adds them to a monthly
updating digest!

## TODO

- [x] Implement basic functions
- [x] Make the fucking CI (urgent)
- [x] Automatic monthly playlist creation

## Usage

Get a credentials.json by (1) enable google drive api, (2) create service account, (3) json key for serivce account
